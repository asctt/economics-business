## What the task assesses

In completing this task, you are showing evidence of having achieved the [Year 9 Economics and Business Achievement Standard](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/humanities-and-social-sciences/economics-and-business/?year=12559&strand=Economics+and+Business+Knowledge+and+Understanding&strand=Economics+and+Business+Skills&capability=ignore&capability=Literacy&capability=Numeracy&capability=Information+and+Communication+Technology+%28ICT%29+Capability&capability=Critical+and+Creative+Thinking&capability=Personal+and+Social+Capability&capability=Ethical+Understanding&capability=Intercultural+Understanding&priority=ignore&priority=Aboriginal+and+Torres+Strait+Islander+Histories+and+Cultures&priority=Asia+and+Australia%E2%80%99s+Engagement+with+Asia&priority=Sustainability&elaborations=true&elaborations=false&scotterms=false&isFirstPageLoad=false) 

Pay attention to these aspects of the Achievement Standard:

* "[Students] explain the importance of managing financial risks and rewards and analyse the different strategies that may be used"

* "When researching, students develop questions and simple hypotheses to frame an investigation of an economic or business issue"

* "[Students] gather and analyse relevant data and information from different sources to answer questions, identify trends and explain relationships" 

* "Students generate alternative responses to an issue and use cost-benefit analysis and appropriate criteria to propose a course of action"

(Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority [ACARA], n.d.a)


In completing this task, you will draw on your skills from the [General Capabilities](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/general-capabilities). This site will guide you to pay attention to [Literacy](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/general-capabilities/literacy/), [Numeracy](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/general-capabilities/numeracy/) and [Information and Communitication (ICT)](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/general-capabilities/information-and-communication-technology-ict-capability/) capabilities where needed.


## Why there so much guidance

It may look like much of the task is in the form of follow the instructions, but these are just steps to guide you to the real task of thinking.

As students, you will develop stronger skills in critically thinking about issues if your reading is carefully guided (Healy, 2008, p.23). This will also help you appreciate the "design components" of the various sources and presentation piece (Healy, 2008, p.27). Directing you to "important features" "complements" your learning as you engage with the task (Tan, 2008, p.156).
