**Phone call transcript**

[You] Good morning, this is ____ calling from AFM regarding your recent online enquiry. 

[Mr Luck] *Oh Hi, thanks for getting in contact.* 

[You] I should like to set a time for you to come into the office but first, can I find out a little more about your goals and your situation? 

[Mr Luck] *Of course. I am studying Biological Science and will graduate next year, just after my 21st birthday. My income comes from casual content writing work for a web-based news company. The reason I want financial advice is that I won about $140 000 as part of the first division in the lottery and I don't want that luck to go to waste.*  

[You] I see, congratulations on your win and also seeking to put it to good use. What have you considered so far as investments?  

[Mr Luck] *My aunt suggested buying half an investment property - a town house. A friend from uni has switched to part-time study because his online holiday business is growing. Honestly, I do not know much about it but he suggested buying in to help fund the next stage.* 

[You] Tell me about your long and short term goals? 

[Mr Luck] *In the long term, I want to buy a house, so I was thinking it could be a deposit when I start earning a salary - but that's another year away at least and I think maybe a fixed term deposit is more sensible. After graduation, I would like to spend about $6000 on a skiing holiday in Japan.*    

[You] Do you have any protections against unforeseen circumstances? Also, you mention $33 000 of debt. Can you elaborate? 

[Mr Luck] *I have $8 000 outstanding for my car loan. The other is what my HECS debt will be at the end of next year,* *$25 000. I live with family so there is flexibility to pay my rent and other expenses as much as I am able to. I don't have insurance or anything like that. I have financial security; The win has not changed my plans --- I just don't want to fritter it away.*  

[You] Thank you for elaborating. We will set a time to meet at your convenience and I will be able to explain your options.
